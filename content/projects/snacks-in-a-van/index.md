Deployed customer and vendor website application where users are allowed to
create account, log in, change account details, order food, find the nearest vans and
leave ratings. Passport.js is utilized to assist the authentication requests.
The user interface was carefully designed using Adobe XD and further implemented
using Express.js and MongoDB. Unit, integration and functional testing with Jest
were done to ensure controller functions are implemented correctly.
