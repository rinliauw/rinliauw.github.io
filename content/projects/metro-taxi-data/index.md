The full data science cycle was applied: data collected from the New York City TLC
for Yellow Taxis within three months are analyzed, visualized, and modeled to
increase customerâ€™s satisfaction on the usage of Yellow Taxi Apps by precisely
predicting the upfront pricing for trips booked through the app. Preliminary
analysis, such as geospatial analysis using geopandas and correlation analysis are
done to better understand the data. Statistical modeling was done by Lasso and
Linear Regression.
