Created models for time series data prediction in the electrical energy market using
Python for Deloitte as a data science industry project. Engineered an algorithm to
maximize revenue and coalesced it with the predicted prices to form a sustainable
revenue- generating moving algorithm. Predicted future prices using time-series
models (Vector Auto-regressions and ARMA).
