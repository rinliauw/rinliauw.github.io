Human pose recognition, and related tasks like gesture recognition and action recognition, are important tasks for AI systems that interact with people.
In this project, a supervised Naive Bayes learner was implemented to classify pose from key- points provided by a deep convolutional neural network. I then trained, tested, and evaluated the classifier on a provided dataset and extended the basic model to answer conceptual questions.
